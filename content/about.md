I've always been fascinated by humans, because we are so full of apparent contradictions. We love, we hate, we desire, we despise; sometimes all of these at once with regards to a single subject. 

My interest in AI & Machine learning started when I got into bit of an argument with one such "subject" - my husband. I can't say what it was about, only that I was probably wrong, and I decided that under no circumstances did I want to speak to another human about my complaints (because they would probably point out that I was wrong). So I decided to find a chatbot to vent my ire at. 

This was back in...oh, say 2015, and chatbots weren't very good at maintaining conversational context. It kept forgetting _why_ I was mad in between sympathetic platitudes...unfortunately this was not enough to come close to giving me the validation I was looking for. So I decided to write one myself, and started learning AIML.

That was the beginning of a very. Long. Road.

Life is funny like that.
